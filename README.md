&nbsp;
## 00 Start the project
* In VS, create a Windows Forms Application project.

&nbsp;
## 01 Add the form
* Four buttons, three TextBoxes, a DateTimePicker and labels.

&nbsp;
## 02 Add the folder button click code
* Add a folderBrowserDialog.
* Show the folder dialog box with the folder button click.
* If the dialog result is ok, enable the Save, Open and Random buttons.

&nbsp;
## 03 Edit the file date label
* Instead of the third TextBox, the file date for the excuse file is displayed by the use of a Label control with AutoSize set to False and BorderStyle set to Fixed3D.
